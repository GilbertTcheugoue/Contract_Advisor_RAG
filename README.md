# Contract_Advisor_RAG

The goal of this challenge is to build, evaluate and improve a RAG system for Contract Q&A (chatting with a contract and asking questions about the contract).

# Business Objective

The Project aims to develop a fully autonomous contract bot, capable of drafting, reviewing, and negotiating contracts, independently, end-to-end, without human assistance for  Lizzy AI, an early-stage Israeli startup, developing the next-generation contract AI.
Our task is as follows:  build, evaluate and improve a RAG system for Contract Q&A (chatting with a contract and asking questions about the contract).

# Project Structure

The project consists of the following :

1. Researching ways to improve RAG systems, including efficiency, scalability, personalization, contextualization, and bias reduction.
   
2. Building a simple Q&A pipeline with RAG using Langchain, a leading LLM application framework.
   
3. Creating a RAG evaluation pipeline with RAGAS to assess the performance of the system.
   
4. Implementing enhancements to optimize the system for Contract Q&A.
   
5. Interpretation & Reporting: Presenting the outcomes of the project with a short deck and providing performance metrics to quantify incremental improvements.

# Dependencies

The project requires the following libraries and frameworks:

Langchain: a leading LLM application framework

RAGAS: a RAG evaluation framework

Hugging Face Transformers: a library for state-of-the-art NLP models

# Run 

To run the project, follow these steps:
